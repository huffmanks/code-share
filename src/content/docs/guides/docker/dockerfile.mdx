title: Dockerfile
description: A Dockerfile is a script that contains a set of instructions to automate the creation of Docker container images. It defines the base image, dependencies, configurations and commands needed to build and run an application inside a container.

## Creating a Dockerfile

To create a `Dockerfile`, follow these steps:

<Steps>

    1. ### Make directory

        ```sh wrap preserveIndent
        mkdir my-docker-project && cd my-docker-project
        ```

    2. ### Create a `Dockerfile`

        ```sh
        nano Dockerfile
        ```

    3. ### Edit the `Dockerfile`

        ```dockerfile title=Dockerfile wrap preserveIndent
        # Use a base image
        FROM node:20-alpine

        # Set working directory
        WORKDIR /app

        # Copy package files and install dependencies
        COPY package.json package-lock.json ./
        RUN npm install --only=production

        # Copy application source
        COPY . .

        # Expose port and define start command
        EXPOSE 3000
        CMD ["node", "server.js"]
        ```

</Steps>

---

## Build the image

Once your `Dockerfile` is ready, build the image using the following command:

```sh
docker build -t my-app .
```

- `-t my-app` gives the image a name (`my-app`).
- `.` specifies the build context (current directory).

To verify the built image:

```sh
docker images
```

---

## Running the container

To run a container from the built image:

```sh wrap preserveIndent
docker run -d -p 3000:3000 --name my-running-app my-app
```

- `-d` runs the container in detached mode.
- `-p 3000:3000` maps the container port to the host.
- `--name my-running-app` assigns a name to the running container.

To check running containers:

```sh
docker ps
```

To stop the container:

```sh
docker stop my-running-app
```

## Optimizing with Slim

<ParagraphWithLink
  href="https://github.com/slimtoolkit/slim"
  label="Slim (SlimToolkit)"
  text="helps reduce Docker image size by removing unnecessary files and dependencies and by improving the overall security and performance of the image."
/>

<Steps>

    1. ### Install

        ```sh wrap preserveIndent
        curl -sLf https://raw.githubusercontent.com/slimtoolkit/slim/master/scripts/install-slim.sh | sudo sh
        ```

    2. ### Run Slim

        ```sh wrap preserveIndent
        slim build --target my-app --tag my-app-slim
        ```

    3. ### Check the size difference

        ```sh
        docker images
        ```

    4. ### Run the optimized image

        ```sh
        docker run -d -p 3000:3000 my-app-slim
        ```

</Steps>

## Buildx

If you need to build an image for a different CPU architecture (e.g., ARM on an x86 machine), you can use Docker buildx. Buildx supports multi-platform builds and allows you to cross-compile images. This ensures your image can run on multiple architectures without needing native hardware.

### Enable buildx

Ensure buildx is enabled:

```sh
docker buildx create --use
```

### Build for a specific architecture

To build an image for an ARM64 architecture:

```sh wrap preserveIndent
docker buildx build --platform linux/arm64 -t my-app-arm64 .
```

### Build multi-platform images

To build for multiple architectures at once:

```sh wrap preserveIndent
docker buildx build --platform linux/amd64,linux/arm64,linux/arm/v7 -t my-multiarch-app .
```

If pushing to a registry (e.g., Docker Hub), add `--push`:

```sh wrap preserveIndent
docker buildx build --platform linux/amd64,linux/arm64,linux/arm/v7 -t my-dockerhub-user/my-multiarch-app --push .
```

## Example Dockerfile

This Dockerfile leverages multi-stage builds, dependency caching and a non-root user to create a secure, lightweight and efficient container.

```dockerfile title=Dockerfile wrap preserveIndent
# Stage 1: Build
FROM node:20-alpine AS builder

# Set working directory
WORKDIR /app

# Copy package.json and package-lock.json
COPY package.json package-lock.json ./

# Install dependencies with caching optimization
RUN npm ci --only=production && npm cache clean --force

# Copy the rest of the application files
COPY . .

# Build the application (if needed)
RUN npm run build

# Stage 2: Production-ready Image
FROM node:20-alpine

# Create and use a non-root user for security
RUN addgroup -S appgroup && adduser -S appuser -G appgroup
USER appuser

# Set working directory
WORKDIR /app

# Copy built app and dependencies from builder stage
COPY --from=builder /app ./

# Expose application port
EXPOSE 3000

# Use a non-root user for running the application
CMD ["node", "server.js"]
```

1. ### Multi-stage build

   - The first stage (`builder`) installs dependencies and builds the app.
   - The final stage only includes the necessary files, reducing image size.

2. ### Dependency caching

   - `npm ci --only=production` ensures reproducibility and avoids unnecessary package installations.
   - Copying `package.json` before other files allows Docker to cache dependencies efficiently.

3. ### Security enhancements
   - **Non-root user:** Runs the container with a dedicated user instead of `root`, reducing attack vectors.
   - **Minimal base image:** Uses `node:20-alpine` to keep the image small and secure.
