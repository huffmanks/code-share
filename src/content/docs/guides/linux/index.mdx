1. ## ssh

   Secure Shell (SSH) allows you to access your Linux system remotely. In this step, you'll configure SSH login, ensuring you can securely connect to your system from another machine.

   <Steps>

   1. ### Verify ssh service is running

      <Code lang="sh" code={`systemctl status ssh`} />

   2. ### Install openssh-server

      <Code lang="sh" code={`sudo apt install openssh-server -y`} />

   3. ### Enable ssh service

      <Code lang="sh" code={`sudo systemctl enable --now ssh`} />

   4. ### ssh login

      <Code lang="sh" code={`ssh {{{USERNAME_VAR}}}@{{{IP_ADDRESS_VAR}}}`} />

   5. ### Restart ssh service

      <Code lang="sh" code={`sudo systemctl restart ssh`} />

   </Steps>

2. ## Update and upgrade system packages

   Itâ€™s important to keep your system updated to ensure security patches and software improvements are applied. This step shows you how to update your package list and upgrade all installed packages using APT.

   <Code lang="sh" code={`sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y`} />

3. ## Reboot the system

   After performing updates or system changes, it's often necessary to reboot your system. This step ensures all updates take effect, and your system is ready for use with the latest configurations and security patches.

   <Code lang="sh" code={`sudo reboot`} />

</Steps>
