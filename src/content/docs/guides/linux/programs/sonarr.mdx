<Steps>

1.  ## Install

    Run the official install script for Debian-based systems:

    ```sh
    curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Sonarr/Sonarr/develop/distribution/debian/install.sh | sudo bash
    ```

2.  ## Add user to groups

    Give your user and Sonarr permission to access the `media` group and each otherâ€™s files:

    ```sh
    sudo usermod -aG media {{USERNAME_VAR}}
    sudo usermod -aG media sonarr
    ```

3.  ## Set folder group and permissions

    Change group ownership of your `Videos` directory and restrict access so only members of the group can read/write:

    ```sh
    sudo chgrp -R media /home/{{USERNAME_VAR}}/Videos
    sudo chmod -R 775 /home/{{USERNAME_VAR}}/Videos
    ```

4.  ## Make directories inherit group

    Ensures that any new folders created under `Videos` will automatically use the `media` group:

    ```sh
    sudo find /home/{{USERNAME_VAR}}/Videos -type d -exec chmod g+s {} +
    ```

5.  ## Open web ui

    <OpenWebUI port="8989" />
